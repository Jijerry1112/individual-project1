## Progress Update

In this checkpoint, I implemented interactive Blackjack gameplay using React state and event handlers. The player and dealer hands are stored in state, and actions such as Deal, Hit, and Stand update the state and trigger re-renders. I also implemented a controlled Settings modal using checkbox inputs managed by React state. These interactions support the project goal of building a playable Blackjack interface. Next, I plan to improve scoring logic (Ace handling), implement dealer drawing behavior, and add win/lose conditions.
